interactive console-based file finder
================================================================

A simple console app that indexes and allows you to search for and
open files.

Press return to open a file (by default in a new gvim tab),
Ctrl+c to copy the path to the currently selected file.

Spaces are wildcards, and you can use slashes to search directory paths
(although you can only find files, not directories).
