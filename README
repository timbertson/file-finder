open files based on a query
================================================================

A simple console app that indexes and allows you to search for and open files.

If you have inotify for python (linux only), it'll keep track of changes while it runs (so you don't need to re-index).
If you have the python "termstyle" package installed, you'll get fancy coloured results, too!

Dependencies
------------

Gedit Open Files is written in Python, so doesn't need compiling, however you will
need the following runtime dependencies:

  * Python 2.4 or later
  * sqlite3

The following python packages are optional (but make things more awesome):
  * pyinotify
  * termstyle

Installation
------------

sudo easy_install file-finder
